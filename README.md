- 👋 Hi, I’m @flexydave
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing
an app that can reach out to any one near the users society,
if the user is looking for a profession that can help the 
user in somethings the user need. For instance,
if the user needs a plumber to fix his/her pipe,
the app should be able to locate the nearest profession in
users society.
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach me via
my email @davidattah748@gmail.com or simply whatsapp me
@ +234 9018191537. Looking forward in working with u😁😁
